       <h3>Combat</h3>

       />
       <h4>Tank</h4>
       <p>Tanking in this game is what we lovingly refer to as "masochism". You're a damage sponge, getting knocked into next Tuesday so your fragile, squishy peers don't rage quit and never speak to you again. Fortunately this means you're above reproach, and if any DPS dare complain you pull too many enemies you can just turn off enmity and let the mobs get them.</p>
       
       <h4>Heal</h4>
       <img src="images/Healer_Icon.png"
       alt="Final Fantasy 14 healer role icon. It is a cross on a green field."
       width="40"
       height="40"
       title="Healer Icon"
       />
       <p>So you have a god complex and the idea of holding the lives of your peers in your hands is appealing? Do you want to be the healer with a gun meme? This is the job for you. Much like the tank, healers can do no wrong. Tanks will occasionally press you into working harder by leaving enmity off or refusing to mitigate the damage they're taking, in which case you're well within your rights to let them sweat it out a bit without heals. If they die, they die. What does it matter that the rest of the party is next? They'll learn their lesson.</p>
       
       <h4>DPS</h4>
       <img src="images/DPS_Icon.png"
       alt="Final Fantasy 14 damage dealer role icon. It is a short sword on a red field."
       width="40"
       height="40"
       title="DPS Icon"
       />
       <p>Damage dealers! Magical or physical, ranged or up close and personal. You'll be the one putting the big numbers up on the baddies. Sadly, everyone hates you. But hey, it's okay, you have three times as many job options as the other roles. Sometimes you even get a fancy hat.</p>

       <h3>Craft</h3>

       alt="Final Fantasy 14 crafter role icon. It is an anvil, a saw, and a star on a purple field."
       width="40"
       height="40"
       title="Crafter Icon"
       />
       <p>Not a fan of all that violence? Bored out of your mind grinding levels fighting the same three enemies for six hours, but somehow you can find your zen sitting in the same place making four hundred metal ingots in a row? Boy howdy do I have good news for you.</p>
       
       <h3>Gather</h3>
       <img src="images/Gatherer_Icon.png"
       alt="Final Fantasy 14 gatherer role icon. It is a fish and a stalk of wheat on an orange field."

       />
       <p>Have you ever wanted to perform back-breaking manual labor for fun? Labor you can't even benefit from yourself unless you spend just as long crafting items from the materials you hoard? Well, at least you can sell this mountain of rocks to a jeweler and get rich...eventually?</p>
