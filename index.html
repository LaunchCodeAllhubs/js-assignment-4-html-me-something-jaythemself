          <h4>Tank</h4>
          </div>
            <div id="tank-description">
            <p>Tanking in this game is what we lovingly refer to as "masochism". You're a damage sponge, getting knocked into next Tuesday so your fragile, squishy peers don't rage quit and never speak to you again. Fortunately this means you're above reproach, and if any DPS dare complain you pull too many enemies you can just turn off enmity and let the mobs get them.</p>
            </div>
        <!--heal-->
          <div id="heal-icon">
          <img src="images/Healer_Icon.png"

          <h4>Heal</h4>
          </div>
            <div id="heal-description">
            <p>So you have a god complex and the idea of holding the lives of your peers in your hands is appealing? Do you want to be the healer with a gun meme? This is the role for you. Much like the tank, healers can do no wrong. Tanks will occasionally press you into working harder by leaving enmity off or refusing to mitigate the damage they're taking, in which case you're well within your rights to let them sweat it out a bit without heals. If they die, they die. What does it matter that the rest of the party is next? They'll learn their lesson.</p>
            </div>
        <!--dps-->
          <div id="dps-icon">
          <img src="images/DPS_Icon.png"

          <h4>DPS</h4>
          </div>
            <div id="dps-description">
            <p>Damage dealers! Magical or physical, ranged or up close and personal. You'll be the one putting the big numbers up on the baddies. Sadly, everyone hates you. But hey, it's okay, you have three times as many job options as the other roles. Sometimes you even get a fancy hat.</p>

          <p>Not a fan of all that violence? Bored out of your mind grinding levels fighting the same three enemies for six hours, but somehow you can find your zen sitting in the same place making four hundred metal ingots in a row? Boy howdy do I have good news for you.</p>
        
          <h4>Gather</h4>
          <img src="images/Gatherer_Icon.png"

          />
          <p>Have you ever wanted to perform back&nbsp;breaking manual labor for fun? Labor you can&apos;t even benefit from yourself unless you spend just as long crafting items from the materials you hoard? Well, at least you can sell this mountain of rocks to a jeweler and get rich...eventually?</p>

       <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
       <p id= "testP">You mean you expected me to talk about the MMO part of the critically aclaimed MMORPG? Gross. If you're SOCIAL I <i>guess</i> you can fight in giant boss battles with friends, or form a company with them, or roleplay with <s>strangers</s> future friends. But really, what kind of a freak are you? Who utilizes the multiplayer elements in a multiplayer game? //Maybe link joke videos like the crap guides. can use a sourcing element?</p>
